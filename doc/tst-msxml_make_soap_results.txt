Quality of generated XML w.r.t. wanted output.  Meaning must be preserved.

"Outer" below means the levels of SOAP-ENV:Envelope (outmost use of envelope namespace)
and of Login (outmost use of wso2.org namespace).

"Top" means only at the level of SOAP-ENV:Envelope (the top level).

"createNode E + A" means createNode used for creation of elements as well as attributes.

"attr late" means attributes are added _after_ the element has been connected to a parent.

Quality ratings:
	1_Optim  = Perfect, optimized, no redunant declarations
	2_equiv  = Sub-optimal, NS bindings needlessly repeated in children
	4_dang   = Dangerously close to different meaning (if new children added later on)
	5_diff   = Valid XML, no errors, but different meaning than wanted (e.g. an empty NS)
	8_silly  = Same NS binding is given twice in a row (xmlns... xmlns..., ugly & silly)
	9_FAIL   = S_OK was NOT returned by all functions (e.g. setAttributeNode failed)

Versions tested against each other:
	Native = Native msxml3 from winetricks (SP7, tested with wine-1.5.3-165-g10a7dc2)
	b1.5.5 = Built-in msxml3 in wine-1.5.5 (ukd's build, but pure unchanged from git)
	b-ukd4 = Built-in msxml3 in wine-1.5.6-2-gf957cd7 (ukd's own two beta4 patches)
