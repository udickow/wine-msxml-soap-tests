Quality of generated XML w.r.t. wanted output.  Meaning must be preserved.

Quality ratings:
	1_Optimal = Perfect, optimized, no redunant declarations
	2_equiv  = Sub-optimal, NS bindings needlessly repeated in children
	4_danger = Dangerously close to different meaning (if new children)
	5_diff   = Valid XML, no errors, but different meaning than wanted (e.g. an empty NS)
	8_silly  = Same NS binding is given twice in a row (xmlns... xmlns..., ugly & silly)
	9_FAIL   = S_OK was NOT returned by setAttributeNode, so BridgeCentral would fail
